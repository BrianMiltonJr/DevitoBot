Danny Blastin is whenever we scrape a PFP of a user from a twitter user then overlay them in a position to make it look they are being shot by danny.

Currently JIMP is being used with their .blit function.

I have one photo which is a transparent background .png of danny blasting I cropped out of a .gif.

We then lay the PFP to the left somewhere.

The next thing to do is to add a background color behind the images.

Also as far as grabbing the PFP I would love to do it through the API but if need be we can do a ghetto solution and scrape the web page.
