Very easy, we can either
A) Store a bunch of images
B) Find a meme service that spits them out and use those.

Ok so on next look it seems that it's a bitch to just find good danny devito memes. I looked at Imgur and it's possible to get this thing called a galleryhash (Maybe we can find a devito gallery, but I doubt it since they seemed to be admin created boards).

I also tried Reddit, but the memes are weak. I might have to build a meme repository that the bot can access unless I can find something premade. I guess for now I will move onto something new.
