Ok so I couldn't figure out the image stuff right now cause I can't find a good API. So right now I am just downloading danny devito memes off the internet. Most of them are garbage, so due to my pickiness it's probably gonna take a long time to curate a list of mey meys.

I tried Imgur but he API looks weak. They have a memegen route, but it looks abandoned since 2013. Maybe I could scrape google. But the problem is quality > quantity. I want to be restrictive on what I grab..... I don't wanna post some random shit. ome of these don't even have anything to do with danny or they are just pics of him.

I need funny stuff. Stuff to make people smile. hmmmmmmmmm.
