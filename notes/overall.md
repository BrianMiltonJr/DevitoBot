Ok so I couldn't figure out the image stuff right now cause I can't find a good API. So right now I am just downloading danny devito memes off the internet. Most of them are garbage, so due to my pickiness it's probably gonna take a long time to curate a list of mey meys.

I tried Imgur but he API looks weak. They have a memegen route, but it looks abandoned since 2013. Maybe I could scrape google. But the problem is quality > quantity. I want to be restrictive on what I grab..... I don't wanna post some random shit. ome of these don't even have anything to do with danny or they are just pics of him.

I need funny stuff. Stuff to make people smile. hmmmmmmmmm.

Another side note. Alot of these have to do with covid or some stupid political shit. One of them didn't even fit the format and looks like a boomer made it about rioting (right of course). I wonder what makes people so animalistic in nature on events like this.

I wonder how the american people can fall so easily into these political agendas. I'm honestly a "Fence sitter" cause I see stuff on both sides, but the radicals make you not want to even participate in the political game.

tbh I was eligble to vote for the last election (Biden v Trump I), but I didn't cause I just couldn't get drawn into the debate. Time to put the tin foil hat on. What if this is a CIA operation to keep people from voting *Queue X-Files theme*
