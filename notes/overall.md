# Existential crisi over how meme images are gonna found
Ok so I couldn't figure out the image stuff right now cause I can't find a good API. So right now I am just downloading danny devito memes off the internet. Most of them are garbage, so due to my pickiness it's probably gonna take a long time to curate a list of mey meys.

# Starting to cope of Existential crisis
I tried Imgur but he API looks weak. They have a memegen route, but it looks abandoned since 2013. Maybe I could scrape google. But the problem is quality > quantity. I want to be restrictive on what I grab..... I don't wanna post some random shit. ome of these don't even have anything to do with danny or they are just pics of him.

I need funny stuff. Stuff to make people smile. hmmmmmmmmm.

# Rambles
Another side note. Alot of these have to do with covid or some stupid political shit. One of them didn't even fit the format and looks like a boomer made it about rioting (right of course). I wonder what makes people so animalistic in nature on events like this.

I wonder how the american people can fall so easily into these political agendas. I'm honestly a "Fence sitter" cause I see stuff on both sides, but the radicals make you not want to even participate in the political game.

tbh I was eligble to vote for the last election (Biden v Trump I), but I didn't cause I just couldn't get drawn into the debate. Time to put the tin foil hat on. What if this is a CIA operation to keep people from voting *Queue X-Files theme*

# 1,000,000 in a mile roll on images that might trigger twitter
revolt in image name results in a 1 in a 1,000,000 roll to see if it gets used or skipped. These ones will probably piss people off on twitter, but I think they are funny. Who knows they might become linda like ultra rare pepes.


So I found out you can store custom fields on photos. Maybe I can store qutoes to go along with special photos as well as photos that need to have the 1 in 1,000,000 roll. This would help with bruteforcing if this video goes viral and a bunch of people know the workings of the bot.

## A existential crisis on custom exif fields
Ok the custom field thing might be DB related and I don't know if I want to mess with all that shit. The schema would be easy to create. The coupling and costs are what worry me. If I want this thing to run for the rest of my life span it needs to be under $20 maybe $40 Im sure I won't notice this bill. But if im paying some stupid fees im not gonna wanna run the bot lol.

oh fuck I think I just remembered also that pngs don't have exif data. I might have to encode them on the fly or pre-encode them to get custom fields on images.
